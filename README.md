# project-manager

Exploration dashboard for task management

## Usage

First, you need to install all of the dependencies locally. Run:

```shell
npm install
```

Then, to run a development server, Run:
```shell
npm run start-dev
```

In a development server, the compiled scss is bundled together with bundled javascript.

To create a production build, Run:
```shell
npm run build
```
The created build will be placed in /dist folder. In the production build, the compiled scss is extracted to a separate css file 
named main.css
